This Privacy Policy informs you about the nature, scope, and purpose of the collection and use of your personal data.

You have the right to:

- **Access** (Art. 15 GDPR) the data we process about you.
- **Rectification** (Art. 16 GDPR) of inaccurate data.
- **Erasure** (Art. 17 GDPR) of your data ("right to be forgotten").

### 3. Data Processing on our Platform

#### a) Hosting and Provisioning (Firebase App Hosting)

Our platform is hosted by Google Cloud EMEA Ltd., Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland ("Google"). We use Firebase App Hosting. When you access our website, server log files (e.g., IP address, time, browser type) are collected. This processing is necessary to ensure the stable and secure operation of the platform. The legal basis is our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). We have concluded a Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with Google in accordance with Art. 28 GDPR.

#### b) Registration and Authentication (Firebase Authentication)

To create a user account, we process your email address. This is used by the Firebase Authentication service (Google) for secure authentication (e.g., via "magic link"). You are assigned a unique User ID (UID). This processing is necessary for the performance of our user agreement (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).

#### c) Storage of Usage and Contract Data (Firestore)

We use the NoSQL database Firestore (Google) to store your profile data and contract-related information. This includes:

- Your User ID (UID) and email address.
- Your purchased NFT tickets and transaction history.
- Your consent to our Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy (version, timestamp, language).
- Your cookie consents.

This storage is necessary for the performance of the user agreement (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR) and to comply with our legal documentation obligations (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR).

#### d) Special Note: Blockchain Data

Please be aware that transactions of NFT tickets take place on a public blockchain. Your public wallet address and transaction details (e.g., transaction hash, timestamp) are stored permanently, immutably, and publicly viewable in the blockchain's decentralized ledger. We have no control over this data, and it cannot be deleted. By using our service, you acknowledge and agree to this systemic public disclosure.

#### e) Payment Processing

For processing payments (e.g., by credit card), we work with external payment service providers (e.g., Stripe Payments Europe, Ltd.). We do not store full credit card details ourselves. The necessary data (e.g., name, purchase amount, currency) is transmitted to the provider for transaction processing. The legal basis is the performance of a contract (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR).

### 4. Cookies and Consent

We use cookies and similar technologies.

- **Essential Cookies:** These are technically necessary for the basic operation of the platform (e.g., managing your login session). The legal basis is our legitimate interest (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR) or ยง 25(2)(2) of the German TDDDG.
- **Functional & Comfort Cookies:** For all other non-essential cookies, we obtain your explicit consent via our cookie banner. The legal basis is your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR) and ยง 25(1) TDDDG.

You can withdraw your consent at any time in the cookie settings.

### 5. Data Security

We implement comprehensive technical and organizational security measures (e.g., SSL encryption, access controls) to protect your data from unauthorized access and misuse.
