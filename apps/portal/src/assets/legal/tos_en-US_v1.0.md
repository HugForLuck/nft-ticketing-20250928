# Terms of Service

**Effective Date: September 24, 2025 (Version 1.0)**

**Important Notice:** This document is a sample template and does not substitute for legal advice from a qualified attorney.

### 1. Scope and Provider

(1) These Terms of Service (hereinafter "Terms") govern all contracts and the use of the NFT ticketing platform (hereinafter "Platform") operated by [Your Company Name], [Your Address], [Your Email] (hereinafter "we" or "us").

(2) Our services are directed at both consumers and businesses.

(3) The Platform enables event organizers ("Organizers") to create and sell tickets for their events in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and allows ticket buyers ("Buyers") to purchase these NFT tickets and trade them on a controlled secondary market. We act as an intermediary in this process. The contract for attending the event is concluded exclusively between the Organizer and the Buyer.

### 2. Subject Matter and Functionality

(1) The subject of the user agreement is the provision of the technical infrastructure for the creation, purchase, custody, and transfer of NFT tickets.

(2) **NFT Tickets:** Each ticket on this Platform is a unique cryptographic token (NFT) on a public blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon). The NFT represents the right to attend the respective event according to the Organizer's conditions.

(3) **Digital Wallet:** To use the Platform, a compatible, self-custodial digital wallet (e.g., MetaMask) is required. You are solely responsible for securing your wallet, your private keys, and your credentials. We never have access to your wallet or the assets within it. Losing access to your wallet may result in the permanent and irretrievable loss of your NFT tickets.

### 3. Registration and User Account

(1) Registration is completed by associating your email address with your user account.

(2) You agree to provide truthful information during registration and to keep your data current.

(3) By registering, you agree to these Terms and acknowledge our Privacy Policy. Your consent will be stored in our database (Firestore) along with your user ID, the accepted version of the terms, and a timestamp.

### 4. Organizer's Obligations

(1) The Organizer is solely responsible for the organization and execution of the event. They define the ticket prices, quantities, and specific admission policies.

(2) The Organizer warrants that they hold all necessary rights to conduct the event and sell the tickets.

(3) In the event of a cancellation or rescheduling, the Organizer is solely responsible for handling refunds and any related communication with Buyers.

### 5. Ticket Purchase and Payment

(1) The purchase of an NFT ticket constitutes a binding contract between you and the respective Organizer.

(2) Payments are processed via the methods offered on the Platform (e.g., credit card). We use third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe) for this purpose.

(3) **Blockchain Transaction Fees ("Gas Fees"):** Transferring the NFT ticket to your wallet may incur transaction fees from the respective blockchain network. These fees are variable and are not collected or controlled by us. They will be displayed in your wallet before you confirm the transaction and are your responsibility.

### 6. Right of Withdrawal

In accordance with applicable law (e.g., ยง 312g Abs. 2 Nr. 9 of the German Civil Code, BGB), there is generally **no right of withdrawal** for contracts concerning services related to leisure activities, if the contract provides for a specific date or period of performance. This applies to the purchase of event tickets. All purchases are therefore final.

### 7. Controlled Secondary Market

(1) You may offer purchased NFT tickets for resale exclusively on the secondary market provided by us. The Organizer may set price caps for resales.

(2) For each successful sale on the secondary market, we charge a service fee, which is transparently displayed before you list your ticket.

(3) Any trading of tickets outside the Platform is prohibited and may lead to the ticket and/or your account being suspended.

### 8. Limitation of Liability

(1) Our liability is unlimited for intent and gross negligence, as well as for damages arising from injury to life, body, or health.

(2) In the case of a slightly negligent breach of a material contractual obligation, our liability is limited to the foreseeable, typical damage.

(3) We are not liable for the execution, quality, or cancellation of events. Furthermore, we are not liable for the loss of NFT tickets due to improper handling of your wallet, phishing, or other security incidents for which you are responsible. The use of blockchain technology involves inherent risks (e.g., network congestion, smart contract vulnerabilities) for which we assume no liability.

### 9. Data Protection

We process your personal data in accordance with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For detailed information, please see our Privacy Policy.

### 10. Final Provisions

(1) These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, excluding the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.

(2) Should any provision of these Terms be or become invalid, the validity of the remaining provisions shall not be affected.

(3) The place of jurisdiction for all disputes arising from this contractual relationship shall be [Your Jurisdiction], provided you are a merchant or a legal entity under public law.
